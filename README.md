# COVID: Bad for lungs; good for air?

The COVID-19 outbreak that hit the US shores in February 2020 fundamentally changed the societal operations to which we'd grown accustomed.  Restaurants, bars, schools, and gyms were shut down; air traffic plummeted. And all this got me thinking: has the Air Quality Index (AQI) in major metropolitan areas across the US significantly decreased in 2020, specifically in the months from March-June(~approx present)? Has decreased air and vehicular travel, an expansion of remote work, combined with other factors, in the COVID-19 era resulted in a noteworthy shift in AQI from what we would otherwise expect?  Let's check out what the numbers have to say.

# Background

##### Why is Air Quality Index (AQI) an important statistic and who does it affect?
 - AQI gives us a measure of the quality of the air we breath, and most importantly lets us know when prolonged exercise and exposure might be harmful to human health.  For at least 1 in 13 of us - this is the rate of Asthma in the US - and others afflicted by respirtory illnesses, the AQI directly informs whether or not outdoor activity is safe and for how long.  For many suffering from respirtory illnesses, the average AQI in a given city may even dictate where they choose to live.  If you are in this population, it's likely you reference the AQI on a daily basis.  
 
##### What goes in to calculating the AQI?
  - AQI is calculated based on four main factors: Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, and Particle Pollution.
    Each of the factors vary in the degree to which their concentration is considered harmful, and to handle this each factor         is normalized from a ppm (parts per million) value to AQI.  
  - When the statistic was first measured and recorded in 1968, it was summarized into a single cumulative AQI value (0-500),         and today they offer the AQI in each category in addition the cumulative AQI value.
